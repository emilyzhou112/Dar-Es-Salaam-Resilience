# Water Amenity Accessibility Under Flood Scenario in Dar es Salaam

Zhou, E

## Abstract

Many developing countries are facing water accessibility crisis under climate change. Structural poverty, high population density, poor municipal infrastructure, and factors of many other kinds have been continuously compounding this problem. This analysis examines resilience and vulnerability to flood in the city of Dar es Salaam in terms of householdsâ€™ access to water amenities. Using data from Resilience Academy and Open Street Map, the analysis demonstrates that significant number of households in Dar es Salaam do not have access to water during flood. It also illustrates how uneven population and water amenity distribution are the primary reason responsible for such vulnerability.
